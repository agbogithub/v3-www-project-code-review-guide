This page is written to satisfy three different perspectives.
1. Management teams who wish to understand why code reviews are needed. In particular, Senior management should thoroughly read (non technical pages here).
			
For implementing the code review guide into the organization's work-progress, management should consider the following:
			
- "Does the organization project estimation allot time for code reviews?
- "Does management have the capability to tract the relevant metrics for code review and static analysis for each project and programmer?"
- "blah blah..."
			

2. Software leads who want to give feedback to peers in code review, with ample empirical artifacts as what to look for in helping to create secure software for their organizations.
			
As a peer code reviewer, use this documentation to decide on the type of code review you want to accomplish. Spend a few moments going over each type of code review and determine how each can be of assistance.

			
3. Secure code reviewers who want an updated guide on how secure code reviews integrate into the organizations secure software development lifecycle.
